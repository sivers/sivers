tables.sql
============
This is the heart of it. Start there. Read that.


table-refs.sql
============
`tables.sql` has circular references, so foreign keys added after data is loaded.


scripts/reset.sh
============
All functions - (except for a few at the top of tables.sql) - are in schemas.  
Schemas can be dropped and reloaded without losing the data in the tables.  
Run `scripts/reset.sh` every time a function has changed, to reload them all.  
This also creates a database for testing.  More on that, below.


omni/\*.sql
============
Functions used by multiple web apps.  Schema name: `o`.  
One file per function except `TRIGGERS.sql`


\*/test/\*.sql
============
For each function, tests in the test/ directory, in a file with the same name.  
Tests use pgTAP. See <https://pgtap.org/>  
Tests are run on the test database (`siverstest`) a clone of the live database.  
Minimal data is inserted for testing just this function.  
This makes it easier to understand without keeping anything else in mind.  
To run a test, boilerplate and psql env vars are in a script called `tap`.  
It's in `scripts/tap` here, but put it in your $PATH so you can always do ...  
`tap thatfile.sql`  
... to run that file's tests with nice output and rollback.  
Or to run all tests:  
`for f in *.sql ; do tap $f ; done`


scripts/
============
Hands-on or cron, shell scripts are here.


templates/
============
HTML templates to be loaded into templates table, where code = file name.  
Never used on disk, only in the database, but put here for easy editing.  
Mustache parser inside PostgreSQL - see `omni/template.sql`


HTML in PostgreSQL?
============
Typical db-driven web apps get values from db, then merge into HTML templates.  
Aiming for simplicity - less coupling - I do that step directly in PostgreSQL.  
Router calls PostgreSQL functions and gets a full HTML response.  
Pass it directly to HTTP or write it to disk.


HTTP headers in PostgreSQL?
============
What about when I need a value to be handled outside of the HTML body?  
It usually results in an HTTP header: 404, Set-Cookie then 303 redirect, etc.  
So the function creates the HTTP headers when needed to override the default.  
Now all PostgreSQL web functions return just two values: head text, body text.  
head is null? Stick with defaults. (Status 200, text/html, etc.)  
head first line is 3 digits? Use that to override HTTP status. (404, 303)  
head lines otherwise should override defaults.


web functions
============
These two PostgreSQL web app return values (head text, body text) are unified,  
so we can make the handling code shorter with two sugar functions:  
Call handler gets row 0 of `select head, body from {schema}.{function}(params)`  
Response handler converts that PostgreSQL row to an HTTP response.


io-rb/
============
Ruby HTTP servers to parse requests, send to PostgreSQL, and return responses


app schemas
============
Directories keep the functions and tests related to different web apps:

| dir     |site|
|---------|----|
| `blog/` | sive.rs |
| `inch/` | inchword.com |
| `peep/` | people / email |
| `nnn/`  | nownownow.com |
| `shop/` | sivers.com |
