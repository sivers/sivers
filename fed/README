ActivityPub server

For all of my web routes, I wanted PostgreSQL to handle everything
so that the HTTP router could be dumb, just passing HTTP requests
into my PostgreSQL functions.

But alas, ActivityPub needs to do SHA Digest matching of HTTP sigs,
so this webserver needs to be smart.

And it needs an active HTTP client reaching out (via daemon listener)
when I post a new activity into the database.

So really this is almost nothing like the other web apps here.


TODO

/inbox Follow request:
Save in follow_reqs with actor URI.
Insert notifies a listening client to HTTP GET that actor's inbox.
After getting inbox, confirm follow, and save into followers.
